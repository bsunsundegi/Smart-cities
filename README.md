### Initiate PC server and gateway
The operating system chosen for both the PC server and the PC gateway is Ubuntu 22.04. Each one of these PCs are executed in different virtual machines.
For the case of the PC server, Apache Web Server is installed to host the webpage that later will be used.

### Configure basic routing in PC gateway

File: `gateway_iptables.sh`

Directory: `~/1-Configure-global-structure`

### Configure basic routing in PC server

File: `server_iptables.sh`
    
Directory: `~/1-Configure-global-structure`
  
1. Execute `gateway_iptables.sh` in PC gateway and `server_iptables.sh` in PC server and verify that both computers ping each other.

### Configure apache server

The following guide was used to install the Apache Web Server: [Installing Apache Web Server](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-the-apache-web-server-on-ubuntu-22-04)

In the next picture it can bee seen that the web server has been well deployed

### Design simple webpage
If the admin wants to see data such as video surveillance, sensor data or the suggestions submitted by the users in the suggestion box, the webpage deployed for that would look like the following one:

![server_webpage](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73036899/209978766-0ec14590-6ca6-43f5-8864-235af8aa5e55.jpg)

This page has three buttons. Each button corresponds to each one of the 3 possible types of data. If the admin would like to return back to the main page, it would be possible through the button that appears on screen when whichever button is pressed.

### Configure RaspberryPi
At first, the RaspberryPi only has the Raspbian image and the operating system generated by the image. Just by connecting it through HDMI will not work. So in order for this to work, we have to do the following steps.

1. Unplug the RaspberryPi and extract the SD Card.

2. If your computer does not have a MicroSD Card Slot, plug the MicroSD Card to the PC through a MicroSD to USB device.

3. Find the file named 'config.txt' and open it. To be able to send images through HDMI some parameters of this file will have to be modified.
![configtxt](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73036899/209112138-1d22a620-88e8-4885-ae45-ba7c84ab4c03.jpg)

This files are commented with a '#' so just removing the '#' will be enough. The parameters that have to be uncommented are:
  - `hdmi_safe = 1`
  - `hdmi_force_hotplug = 1`
  - `hdmi_drive = 2`
  
  
![hdmi](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73036899/209112929-2fbd5c7a-7e76-47b4-9afe-c42dfb6fbdaf.jpg)

Once this parameters are uncommented, the RaspberryPi HDMI will work.

4. Remove the MicroSD Card from the PC and plug it back to the RaspberryPi.  

5. Switch on the RaspberryPi and connect it to any monitor through HDMI.

The RaspberryPi Boot Image should appear on the screen.
![raspi image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73036899/209113233-feecea97-2b17-48fb-a2f4-c921b6c6b6e6.jpg)

Now, the next step will be to configure Raspbian, the operating system of the RaspberryPi. This configuration is easy, choose the language and region you are the most comfortable with and connect it to a Wi-Fi network if possible, this way the Raspberry can update the software to the latest release.

After this is done, the Raspberry will be configured and ready to use. If everything has been done well, the Desktop should be seen.
![captura_desktop](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73036899/209117910-1fd5273c-c10f-45d1-92e7-8998244c6cd1.png)

### Install camera
First of all, to make this task easier, unplug the RaspberryPi and go to the config.txt file. Find the parameter camera_auto_detect=1 and uncomment it. This will make the RaspberryPi autodetect the camera without needing additional software or hardware.
![camera](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73036899/209114886-27a17085-ee40-46cc-9a0d-370d8bc7ed26.jpg)
  
To test if the camera works, we install a simple camera software called guvcview.
  
For this, open a terminal and execute the following command:
 
  `sudo apt-get update`
  
  `sudo apt-get upgrade`
  
  `sudo apt-get install guvcview`
  
  `sudo usermod -G video pi`
  
  `sudo modprobe uvcvideo`
  
  `reboot`
  
After rebooting the device, a new program should appear in the "sound and video" tab in the main menu called "guvcview".
  
![guvcview](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73036899/209123215-1f7f652f-4b16-4c4f-a97e-1c8cff6201fa.png)
  
Open it and the camera should appear automatically
  
![software_camara](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73036899/209123307-0df4950a-74ac-4a2f-baf3-dbe4a53c798e.png)

To change the IP address of the raspberry, the configuration file `/etc/dhcpcd.conf` has to be modified so anytime the device is switched on it is configured by default and there is no need to execute any additional lines everytime.

Now, to get the video from the webcam, mjpg streamer must be installed. For this, open a terminal and enter the following commands:

`sudo apt update`

`sudo apt install snapd`

`sudo reboot`

`sudo snap install core`

`sudo snap install mjpg-streamer`

This will install a program that detects USB webcams and also serves as a streaming server.

To start streaming video, a terminal must be opened in the Raspberry to enter the following command:

`mjpg_streamer`

To modify the parameters of the video such as the frame rate, the resolution and the port through which the video will exit the Raspberry, execute the following file that has to be in the folder installed by the `sudo snap install mjpg-streamer` command:

`./start.sh`

The file `start.sh` is in the folder 4-Video-surveillance.

To view the video, the html file that corresponds to the video surveillance must be modified. The line that should be added is the following one:

`<img src="http://192.168.1.2:2500/?action=stream" width=800*device_width height=500*device_height />`

You should be able to see the video in real time.

### Test system and troubleshooting
When connecting the Raspberry Pi to a PC monitor, it did not work using display port nor VGA, just using a HDMI-HDMI connection between them. In addition, in the 'config.txt' file the screen resolution needs to be changed, accordingly to monitor's resolution, in the parameter hdmi_mode; in our case a resolution of 640x480 was used.

## Sensor system
A Raspberry Pi simulates multiple data sensors that will be send to the PC Server using MQTT. The PC Server saves the new data in a MySQL database and the webpage can get the data from there.
<details>
<summary>Open to see details</summary>
  
### Configure RaspberryPi
The OS of the Raspberry Pi was downloaded from the official web page and was installed using a Windows PC with a USB, writting the OS on a memory card. Then the memory is inserted on the raspberry and turned it on.

The next step is to configure the routing by inserting the IP commented on the scheme.

### Install sensors software
For the software it is necessary to install java with the order `sudo apt install java-8-openjdk`. After that it is necessary to set the global variable using `export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-8-openjdk`, this will help minifi when running.
It is also required an MQTT package with `sudo apt install mosquitto-clients`. This allowed us to test the program while running and setting the conections.

### Configure apache MiNiFi
MiNiFi is a lighter version of NiFi that consumes much less resources. This allows the Raspberry Pi to execute some flows created on NiFi. For downloading MiNiFi: `wget https://dlcdn.apache.org/nifi/1.19.1/minifi-1.19.1-bin.zip`, after decompressing the program it is necessary to import the `config.yml` file.
NiFi exports templates in format `xml`, but MiNiFi needs a `yml` and for that it is necessary to also install MiNiFi toolkit with `wget https://dlcdn.apache.org/nifi/1.19.1/minifi-toolkit-1.19.1-bin.zip` and decompressing that zip to. Once the toolkit is ready the command while staying on the main folder of the program on root user: `./bin/config.sh transform <input_file.xml> <output_file.yml>`. The last step is the move the new `yml` file to the folder `${minifi_path}/conf/config.yml`.

With the program ready to be executed: `./bin/minifi.sh start` being on the root folder of the minifi download.

### NiFi program
The MQTT publisher and subscriber were created using NiFi.

Publisher works with three street lights sending data over MQTT to the Server PC using Gateway PC path.
![NiFi](img/nifi_publishers.jpg)

Each process has the same structure, using three blocks conforming a JSON which will be sent to the server. The JSON structure is represented in `5-Sensos-system/
![Publisher_1](img/nifi_publishers2.jpg)

This proccess saves the data to a MySQL database but during the proccess it extract the JSON data and updates the DATETIME atribute to a `YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm:ss` format.
![Subscriber](img/nifi_subscriber.jpg)

### Configure routing in PC gateway

The PC gateway was already configured to allow routing throwards the machine. It also has installed the mosquitto package because the PC is the broker which join the publishers and the subscribers of the protocol.

### Configure database
The database was MySQL database. The install is `sudo apt install mysql-server` and the access to the DB is `sudo mysql -u smartcities -p`.
The database was made following the next structure:
```sql
  CREATE TABLE SENSORS (
    REGISTERID INT(10) PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    SENSORID VARCHAR(25),
    LATITUDE DECIMAL(8, 6),
    LONGITUDE DECIMAL(9, 6),
    DATETIME DATETIME,
    TEMPERATURE INT(3),
    ENERGY INT(3),
    LIGHTSTATUS BIT(1)
  );
```

### Improve webpage
In the webpage was added a php file that makes a query to the database for knowing the IDs of the sensors inside the database. Then other php file do another query which shows the data from the last 2 weeks in order from most recent to the oldest.

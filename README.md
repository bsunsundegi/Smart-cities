## Configure global structure

### Initiate PC server and gateway
The operating system chosen for both the PC server and the PC gateway is Ubuntu 22.04. Each one of these PCs are executed in different virtual machines.
For the case of the PC server, Apache Web Server is installed to host the webpage that later will be used.

The following guide was used to install the Apache Web Server: [Installing Apache Web Server](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-the-apache-web-server-on-ubuntu-22-04)

In the next picture it can bee seen that the web server has been well deployed

### Configure basic routing in PC gateway

File: `gateway_iptables.sh`

Directory: `~/1-Configure-global-structure`

### Configure basic routing in PC server

File: `server_iptables.sh`
    
Directory: `~/1-Configure-global-structure`
  
1. Execute `gateway_iptables.sh` in PC gateway and `server_iptables.sh` in PC server and verify that both computers ping each other.

### Configure RaspberryPi
At first, the RaspberryPi only has the Raspbian image and the operating system generated by the image. Just by connecting it through HDMI will not work. So in order for this to work, we have to do the following steps.

1. Unplug the RaspberryPi and extract the SD Card.

2. If your computer does not have a MicroSD Card Slot, plug the MicroSD Card to the PC through a MicroSD to USB device.

3. Find the file named 'config.txt' and open it. To be able to send images through HDMI some parameters of this file will have to be modified.
![configtxt](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73036899/209112138-1d22a620-88e8-4885-ae45-ba7c84ab4c03.jpg)

This files are commented with a '#' so just removing the '#' will be enough. The parameters that have to be uncommented are:
  - `hdmi_safe = 1`
  - `hdmi_force_hotplug = 1`
  - `hdmi_drive = 2`
  
  
![hdmi](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73036899/209112929-2fbd5c7a-7e76-47b4-9afe-c42dfb6fbdaf.jpg)

Once this parameters are uncommented, the RaspberryPi HDMI will work.

4. Remove the MicroSD Card from the PC and plug it back to the RaspberryPi.  

5. Switch on the RaspberryPi and connect it to any monitor through HDMI.

The RaspberryPi Boot Image should appear on the screen.

Now, the next step will be to configure Raspbian, the operating system of the RaspberryPi. This configuration is easy, choose the language and region you are the most comfortable with and connect it to a Wi-Fi network if possible, this way the Raspberry can update the software to the latest release.

After this is done, the Raspberry will be configured and ready to use. If everything has been done well, the Desktop should be seen.

### Install camera
First of all, to make this task easier, unplug the RaspberryPi and go to the config.txt file. Find the parameter camera_auto_detect=1 and uncomment it. This will make the RaspberryPi autodetect the camera without needing additional software or hardware.

To test if the camera works, we install a simple camera software called guvcview.
  
For this, open a terminal and execute the following command:
 
  `sudo apt-get update`
  
  `sudo apt-get upgrade`
  
  `sudo apt-get install guvcview`
  
  `sudo usermod -G video pi`
  
  `sudo modprobe uvcvideo`
  
  `reboot`
  
After rebooting the device, a new program should appear in the "sound and video" tab in the main menu called "guvcview".

Open it and the camera should appear automatically
